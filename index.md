# Introduction to Data Analysis in Python

This is a 4-session introductory Python workshop hosted by the Center for Computational Biomedicine at Harvard Medical School. 

Learning Objectives:

- Apply fundamentals of Python programming including variables, expressions, loops, and conditional statements.
- Create modular Python scripts which handle file I/O, string manipulation, and object manipulation.
- Manage Conda environments and lookup documentation to utilize built-in and 3rd party Python packages.
- Manipulate data and objects using Python and Pandas.
- Visualize data in Python using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Participants will also be introduced to popular packages for machine learning and bioinformatics analyses in Python, and pointed towards resources to continue their learning.

## Day Schedule

*Current status*: All lessons still need a final pass for polish and small fixes. 

- The day 1 at home lessons are only about 10% done. 
- The day 3 lessons using data need to have their datasets changed to use biological data. 
- The plotting lesson (not pushed yet) has matplotlib but needs seaborn and some more biological examples like heatmaps. 
- The application example lessons on days 3 and 4 have not been started, though I have existing notebooks I'm planning to base them on.
